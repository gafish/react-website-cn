# 用 React 思考

在我们看来，React 是通过 JavaScript 用来构建大型、高性能 Web 应用的最佳方式。它在 Facebook 和 Instagram 中都应用的非常好。

React 众多好的部分之一是让你思考如何构建应用。在本文档中，我们将跟你一起完成使用 React 构建一个可搜索的产品数据表的思考过程。

## 从一个 Mock 开始

想像一下我们已经有了一个 JSON API，以及从设计师那里拿到的 mock。这个 mock 看起来像这样：

![Mockup](/cn/img/blog/thinking-in-react-mock.png)

我们的 JSON API 返回一些像这样的数据:

```
[
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
];
```

## 第一步: 将 UI 拆解到组件层次结构中

你将要做的第一件事是在mock里画一个容器包裹所有的组件（和子组件），并给它们命名。如果你和一个设计师一起工作，它们可能已经做好了这些，所以去跟他们交流一下！他们的 Photoshop 图层名可能就是你的 React 组件名！

但是你怎么知道什么应该是组件自己的呢？其实就像你创建一个新的函数或对象一样就可以。一种方法是 [单一职责原则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), 即一个组件理论上只做一件事。如果它持续成长，它应该分解到更小的子组件。

由于你经常向用户显示 JSON 数据模型, 你将发现如果你的模型已经正确的构建，你的 UI (以及你的组件结构) 将很好的映射. 那是因为 UI 和 数据模型往往遵循同样的 *信息结构*, 这意味着拆分你的 UI 到组件的工作是微不足道的，只需要将它拆分为精确对应对应数据模型片断即可。

![组件图解](/cn/img/blog/thinking-in-react-components.png)

在这里你将看到在我们的简单应用里有5个组件。我已经用斜体字标注了每个组件代表的数据。

  1. **`FilterableProductTable` (橙色):** 包含全部示例
  2. **`SearchBar` (蓝色):** 接收所有 *用户输入*
  3. **`ProductTable` (绿色):** 显示和过滤基于 *用户输入* 的 *数据集合*
  4. **`ProductCategoryRow` (宝石绿):** 为每个 *category* 显示一个头部
  5. **`ProductRow` (红色):** 为每个 *product* 显示一行

If you look at `ProductTable`, you'll see that the table header (containing the "Name" and "Price" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there's an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of `ProductTable` because it is part of rendering the *data collection* which is `ProductTable`'s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own `ProductTableHeader` component.

Now that we've identified the components in our mock, let's arrange them into a hierarchy. This is easy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

  * `FilterableProductTable`
    * `SearchBar`
    * `ProductTable`
      * `ProductCategoryRow`
      * `ProductRow`

## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vXpAgj" data-default-tab="js" data-user="lacker" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/lacker/pen/vXpAgj/">Thinking In React: Step 2</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it's time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It's best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We'll see why.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using *props*. *props* are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the concept of *state*, **don't use state at all** to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don't need it.

You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with `FilterableProductTable`) or with the ones lower in it (`ProductRow`). In simpler examples, it's usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it's easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

At the end of this step, you'll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have `render()` methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (`FilterableProductTable`) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call `ReactDOM.render()` again, the UI will be updated. It's easy to see how your UI is updated and where to make changes since there's nothing complicated going on. React's **one-way data flow** (also called *one-way binding*) keeps everything modular and fast.

Simply refer to the [React docs](/react/docs/) if you need help executing this step.

### A Brief Interlude: Props vs State

There are two types of "model" data in React: props and state. It's important to understand the distinction between the two; skim [the official React docs](/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html) if you aren't sure what the difference is.

## Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React makes this easy with **state**.

To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: *Don't Repeat Yourself*. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you're building a TODO list, just keep an array of the TODO items around; don't keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, simply take the length of the TODO items array.

Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:

  * The original list of products
  * The search text the user has entered
  * The value of the checkbox
  * The filtered list of products

Let's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Simply ask three questions about each piece of data:

  1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
  2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.
  3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.

The original list of products is passed in as props, so that's not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can't be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.

So finally, our state is:

  * The search text the user has entered
  * The value of the checkbox

## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ORzEkG" data-default-tab="js" data-user="lacker" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/lacker/pen/ORzEkG/">Thinking In React: Step 4</a> by Kevin Lacker (<a href="http://codepen.io/lacker">@lacker</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

OK, so we've identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or *owns*, this state.

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. **This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,** so follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

  * Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
  * Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
  * Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
  * If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

Let's run through this strategy for our application:

  * `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on state and `SearchBar` needs to display the search text and checked state.
  * The common owner component is `FilterableProductTable`.
  * It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in `FilterableProductTable`

Cool, so we've decided that our state lives in `FilterableProductTable`. First, add an instance property `this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false}` to `FilterableProductTable`'s `constructor` to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass `filterText` and `inStockOnly` to `ProductTable` and `SearchBar` as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in `ProductTable` and set the values of the form fields in `SearchBar`.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set `filterText` to `"ball"` and refresh your app. You'll see that the data table is updated correctly.

## Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="qRqmjd" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="rohan10" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Thinking In React: Step 5" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rohan10/pen/qRqmjd">Thinking In React: Step 5</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

So far, we've built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it's time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in `FilterableProductTable`.

React makes this data flow explicit to make it easy to understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.

If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you'll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we've set the `value` prop of the `input` to always be equal to the `state` passed in from `FilterableProductTable`.

Let's think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, `FilterableProductTable` will pass callbacks to `SearchBar` that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the `onChange` event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by `FilterableProductTable` will call `setState()`, and the app will be updated.

Though this sounds complex, it's really just a few lines of code. And it's really explicit how your data is flowing throughout the app.

## And That's It

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you're used to, remember that code is read far more than it's written, and it's extremely easy to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you'll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)
